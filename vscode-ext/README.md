# Duality Language Support for VSCode

Adds support for the Duality programming language.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting
* Language Server Protocol (LSP) support

## Requirements

LSP support requires an installation of the [Duality language server](https://duality-lang.org).

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

The language is still in its very early stages; expect things to be buggy!
